# Performance Log Files

The SubtleByte projects write module performance measurements to dedicated log
files under the `BepInEx/config/VeinWares SubtleByte/` directory to keep the
server console clean.

| Project | Log file |
|---------|----------|
| Production mod (`VeinWares.SubtleByte`) | `performance.log` |
| Rewrite prototype (`VeinWares.SubtleByte.Rewrite`) | `rewrite-performance.log` |
| Performance template (`templates/SubtleByte.Template`) | `template-performance.log` |

All trackers record:

- The module or operation label.
- The duration in milliseconds.
- A timestamp so you can correlate spikes with gameplay events.

Trackers automatically rotate once a log file grows beyond roughly 5 MiB. The
previous contents move to a `.bak` file next to the active log so only the two
most recent batches are kept on disk. You can safely delete either file between
test runsâ€”the next plugin startup will recreate a fresh log.
