# XPRising

## About

This mod provides a mechanism for players to have their level set by gaining XP in the world, primarily by killing enemies.

There is an optional (but recommended) UI mod that supports displaying XP bars and notifications for players.

## Features

### XP system
- Players gain experience by killing enemies
- Admin configurable setting for giving players stat bonuses for each level

### Mastery system
- Allows players to accrue "mastery" towards weapons and bloodlines
- Mastery systems allow stat bonuses to be applied to players

### Wanted system
- A system that tracks player kills against different factions in the game and causes factions to ambush players with enemies as their "heat" level increases.

### Challenge system
- A system to set up challenges for players and records scores that are used on a leaderboard to rank players
